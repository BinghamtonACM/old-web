                <p>The Binghamton ACM is a club for BU students who like to code. Among other things, our chapter holds programming competitions with cash prizes. Our chapter has also started working together with sponsors who are interested in finding Binghamton's most talented CS and math students. The leadership opportunities within the chapter and our programming competitions give students a way to stand out amongst their peers.</p>
